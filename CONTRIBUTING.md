Thank you for considering contributing to Admincraft! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to this project. If you have any questions, feel free to [open a new discussion](https://github.com/joanroig/admincraft/discussions).

### Important

External contributions are highly appreciated, but please be patient as they are triaged based on the maintainers' availability. If you want to work on significant features, please discuss with the maintainers first.

## Prerequisites

- **Familiarity with GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.**
- **Have a basic understanding of Flutter, Docker and WebSockets.**
- **Have Admincraft set up locally for testing.**

## Issues Before PRs

1. **Find or Create an Issue**: Check if an issue already exists for what you want to work on. If not, [open a new issue](https://github.com/joanroig/admincraft/issues).
2. **Fork and Branch**: Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes in the new branch.
4. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit your branch as a pull request (PR) to the `develop` branch. A maintainer will review your PR shortly.

## Workflow

### Branches

- **`main`**: The main branch where the latest stable code lives.
- **`develop`**: The branch for ongoing development.

**Branch Naming Conventions**:

- `fix/` for bug fixes.
- `feat/` for new features.
- `docs/` for documentation updates.

### Commits

Keep commits small and focused. This makes your PR easier to review.

### Pull Requests

In your PR description, please include:

- **What**: Describe the changes made.
- **Why**: Explain the reason for these changes.
- **How**: Outline the approach you took.
- **Testing**: Describe how the changes were tested.

We recommend a self-review before submitting your PR.

### Testing

All PRs should include tests for the changes:

- **Unit Tests**: Test specific functions or features.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure the system works as expected with your changes.

### Documentation

- Document your code with comments.
- If you change user-facing features, update the relevant documentation.

### Release

Releases are created periodically from the `main` branch.
